# Replay-MCBot
 
> API - MCCTeam By Orelio
> 
> Minecraft Faction Bot-Addon with accessibility to ReplayMod Recording. The bot based off of commands will handle replaymod functions (save, stop, uptime, start).
> I plan to add more configurability and more features in the future, there is no bulit in command handler as I am lazy.
