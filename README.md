# Replay-MCBot
 
> API - MCCTeam By Orelio
> 
> Minecraft Faction Bot-Addon with accessibility to ReplayMod Recording. The bot based off of commands will handle replaymod functions (save, stop, uptime, start).
>
> I plan to add more configurability and more features in the future, there is no bulit in command handler as I am lazy. 
>
> The bot will automatically create the settings.ini for the bot itself, and settings.json for the control of the replaymod name and other settings.
>
>The render distance of players and being able to render them will be picked up by render distance which is changeable in settings.ini
